      "Terrakili SARL has secured an agricultural concession of about 48,000 hectares in the Mweka territory of the Kasai province, Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe land was acquired through a thorough process involving traditional authorities, local departments of the Ministry of Land Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, and the provincial and national governments. Decrees were signed by the Governor of the Kasai province for 15,000 hectares and by the President of the Republic for 33,000 hectares.\n\nThe concession comprises thirteen blocks across eight sites — including Ndengamongo II, Itunga Mpende, Ndambo, Itapanya Camp, Inema Makolo, Malongo III, Tena Mashobi and Kin-A-Mbuom — surveyed and demarcated with the Mweka cadastre in 2020. The state leases the concession to Terrakili for 25 years, renewable without limitation.\n\nFarming is planned to begin on the focus areas of Ndambo Bloc 1 and Bloc 2, which together cover about 1,310 hectares.",

Crops are cultivated with modern machinery and technology — including drones for crop surveillance and spraying, and GIS and IoT for precision farm management.\n\nExperienced South African commercial farmers will manage operations and provide training and upskilling for local personnel, as part of the project's wider goals of creating over 500 permanent jobs, supporting smallholder farmers with training and a market for their produce, and building essential community facilities.\n\nThe project sits about 25 km from the town of Mweka, on the Ilebo–Lubumbashi railway line that links the operation to major markets in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi.",

Alongside INERA, CAPSA produces and distributes improved seeds and coaches farmers in better cultivation techniques.\n\nThe model is cooperative: experienced commercial farmers transfer modern methods and soil management skills to local producers, while surrounding technical schools (ITV for veterinary sciences and ITA for agricultural sciences) provide a growing skills base the project intends to support.\n\nThe project's goals include creating more than 150 permanent jobs and 500+ casual roles, guaranteeing smallholder farmers a reliable market for their produce, and contributing to community infrastructure such as a school, health facilities and access to water and electricity.",
